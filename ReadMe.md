# Face Generator!
Face Generator is python desktop app where you can play with some sliders and this will create a noise vector of 100 values , and we take this noise vector feed it to the generator and it will generate the face, how it works? it the power GANs.

# Why ? How?
* I implement this project to test my skills after i toke the 1st course from the GANs specialization provided by deeplearning.ai in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-adversarial-networks-gans?) platform. 
* I trained a GAN on faces from [CelebA dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html), the GAN is implemented using PyTorch, and the app is implemented with PyQT framework.
* You will find the GAN code in the notebook you can upload it to Google Colab and retrain your own model, maybe with other ideas such as Cat Generator, Dog Generator .. be creative!
